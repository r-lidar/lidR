\usage{
lastrees_hamraz(las, nps = 0.25, th = 5, MDCW = 1.5, epsilon = 5,
  CLc = 0.8, Oc = 2/3, CLs = 0.7, Os = 1/3, gap_sensitivity = 6L,
  R = 15.24, filter_profiles = TRUE, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{las}{A LAS object}

\item{nps}{numeric. Nominal point spacing (see reference page 533  section 2)}

\item{th}{numeric. Minimal height. Point below this threshold are not condisered for the segmentation (see reference page 534 section 2)}

\item{MDCW}{numeric. Minimum detectable crown width (page 534 section 2)}

\item{epsilon}{numeric. Small deviation from vertical (page 535 section 2.2.2)}

\item{CLc}{numeric. Crown ratio of a narrow cone-shaped crown (page 535 equation 3)}

\item{Oc}{numeric. Crown radius reduction due to the overlap assuming the narrow cone-shaped tree is situated in a dense stand (page 535 equation 3)}

\item{CLs}{numeric. Crown ratio of a sphere-shaped crown (page 535 equation 4)}

\item{Os}{numeric. Crown radius reduction due to the overlap within a dense stand for the sphere-shaped tree (page 535 equation 4)}

\item{gap_sensitivity}{integer. In the original article, page 535 section 2.2.1, gaps are detected
using six times the interquartile range of square root distance between consecutive points. This
paramter control this value. Default is 6.}

\item{R}{numeric Maximum horizontal distance of vertical profiles (page 535 sectioh 2.1). Any value greater
than a crown is good because this parameter does not affect the result. However, it greatly affects the
computation speed. The lower the value, the faster the method.}

\item{filter_profiles}{logical. This is an addition to the original method to filter dummy profiles
(see details)}

\item{...}{Supplementary options. Currently \code{field} is supported to change the default name of
the new column.}
}
\value{
Nothing (NULL). The original point cloud is updated by reference. The original point cloud has a
new column named 'treeID' containing an ID for each point that refer to a segmented tree.
}
\description{
The segmentation algorithm proposed by Hamraz et al. 2012 (see reference). The classification is
done at the point cloud level and the function returns nothing (NULL). The original point cloud
is updated in place with an ID for each point in a new column \code{treeID}. The user is free to
post-process this output the way he want.
}
\details{
This function has been written by the \code{lidR} authors from the original article. We made our
best to implement as far as possible exactly what is written in the original paper but we
cannot affirm that it is this exact original algorithm.\cr\cr
Also it is important to notice that we have never been able to segment a single tree properly with
this method. The important sensitivity to minor deviation as well as the great number of difficultly
parametrizable imputs lead us to a method that we are not able to use ourselves.\cr\cr
Also, minor variations were introduced to fix some issues that were not adressed in the original paper.
Because the methods described in section 2.2 of the original article appear extremely sensitive to
many minor deviations, we introduced an optionnal additionnal step to clean the profiles used to build
the convex hull. When \code{filter_profiles = TRUE}, profiles that discribe a crown radius smaller than
\code{2*nps} (basically radius that are close to 0) are removed and the convex hull is build considering
the profiles that describe a crown radius comprise between the 10th and the 90th of the radiuses found.
This enable to remove outliers and reduce dummy segmentation but anyway we were not able to segment
the tree with this method.\cr\cr
As a conclusion this algorithm might be considered as a free and open source code provided to be
improved by the community. One can check and study the sources to ensure that it correspond to the
original paper and find potential improvement.\cr\cr
Also the current implementation is known to be slow.
