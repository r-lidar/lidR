## lidR v1.6.0 (2018-07-20)

#### NEW FEATURE

* New function `tree_hulls` that computes a convex or concave hull for each segmented tree.
* New option `stop_early` that enables processing of an entire catolog or stops if an error occurs.
* New function `catalog_retile` supersedes the function `catalog_reshape` and performs the same task while adding much more functionality.

#### ENHANCEMENTS

* When processing a `LAScatalog`, error handling has been seriouly improved. A process can now run until the end even with errors. In this case clusters with errors are skipped.
* When processing  a `LAScatalog`, the graphical progress now uses 3 colors. green: ok, red: error, gray: null.
* `as.spatial()` for `LAS` object preserves the CRS.
* All the functions now have strong assertions to check user inputs.
* `plot.LAScatalog` always displays the catalog with `mapview` by default even if the CRS is empty.
* In `lastrees_dalponte` the matching between the seeds and the canopy is more tolerant. Rasters can have different resolution and/or extent.
* `lasground` uses (as an option) only the last and single returns to perform the segmentation.

#### OTHER CHANGES

* `catalog()` displays a message when finding overlaps between files.
* The LAScatalog class is more thoroughly documented.
* Clusters now align on (0,0) by default when processing a `LAScatalog` by cluster.

#### BUG FIXES

* `lasscanline()` did not compute the scanline because the conditional statement that checked if the field was properly populated was incorrect.
* [[#146](https://github.com/Jean-Romain/lidR/issues/146)] Fix matching between tree tops, raster and canopy raster.
* `tree_detection` when used with a point cloud was not properly coded and tended to miss some trees.
* In `lasclip*` if `ofile` was non empty, the function wrote properly the file but returned a non-expected error.

## lidR v1.5.1 (2018-06-14)

#### BUG FIXES

* The area of a `LAScatalog` was wrongly computed for non square tiles because of a bad copy/paste in the code.
* [[#135](https://github.com/Jean-Romain/lidR/issues/135)] Fix `NULL` class objects returned by `grid_*` functions when processing a `LAScatalog` if the first cluster is empty.
* [[#143](https://github.com/Jean-Romain/lidR/issues/143)] `rumple_index` returns `NA` if not computable.

## lidR v1.5.0 (2018-05-13)

#### SIGNIFICANT CHANGES

* `catalog_options()` is formally deprecated. Use `LAScatalog` properties instead (see `?catalog`).
* The package `magrittr` is no longer loaded with `lidR`. Thus, piping operators are no longer usable by default. To use piping operators use `library(magrittr)`.

#### NEW FEATURES

* New `lassmooth` function. A point cloud-based smoothing function.
* New `lasfiltersurfacepoints` function to filter surface points.
* New `grid_catalog` function is a simplified and more powerful function like `catalog_apply` but specifically dedicated to `grid_*` outputs.
* New functions `lasadddata`, `lasaddextrabyte` and `lasaddextrabyte_manual` to add new data in a `LAS` object.
* `lasclip` can clip a `SpatialPolygonsDataFrame`
* `lasclipRectangle` and `lasclipCircle` can clip multiple selections (non-documented feature).
* The `treeID` computed with `lastrees_*` functions can now be written in a `las/laz` file by default.

#### OTHER CHANGES

* `LAScatalog` objects are processed with a single core by default.
* `lasdecimate` is formally deprecated. Use `lasfilterdecimate`
* `grid_density` now returns both the point and the pulse density, where possible.
* The option `P` is no longer set by default in `readLAS`.
* The documentation of `lastrees` has been split into several pages.
* When a catalog is processed using several cores, if an error is raised the process triggers an early signal to stop the loop. In previous releases the entire process was run and the error was raised at the end when the futures were evaluated.

#### BUG FIXES

* `grid_metrics(lidar, stdmetrics_i(Intensity))` returned and empty `data.table`
* [[#128](https://github.com/Jean-Romain/lidR/issues/128)] Fix raster data extraction using the slower and memory-greedy, but safer `raster::extract` function.
* [[#126](https://github.com/Jean-Romain/lidR/issues/126)] propagate the CRS in filter functions.
* [[#116](https://github.com/Jean-Romain/lidR/issues/116)] Fix clash between function `area` from `lidR` and from `raster`.
* [[#110](https://github.com/Jean-Romain/lidR/issues/110)] Fix out-of-bounds rasterization.

## lidR v1.4.2 (2018-04-19)

* `lastrees` with the Li et al. (2012) algorithm no longer sorts the original point cloud.
* `lastrees` with the Dalponte et al (2016) algorithm is now computed in linear time and is therefore hundreds to millions times faster.
* `catalog_reshape()` streams the data and uses virtually zero memory to run.
* `grid_canopy()` has been rewritten entirely in C++ and is now 10 to 20 times faster both with the option `subcircle` or without it.
* `grid_canopy()` with the option `subcircle` uses only 16 bytes of extra memory to run, while this feature previously required the equivalent of several copies of the point cloud (several hundreds of MB).
* `as.raster()` is now three times faster.
* `lasclassify` now uses a QuadTree and is therefore faster. This enables several algorithms to run faster, such as `lastrees` with Silva's algo.

#### OTHER CHANGES

* `lasground` with the PMF algorithm now accepts user-defined sequences.
* `lasground` with the PMF algorithm has simplified parameter names to make them easier to type and understand, and to prepare the package for new algorithms.
