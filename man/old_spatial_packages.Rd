\description{
\code{rgdal} and \code{rgeos} will be retired on Jan 1st 2024. The \code{raster} and \code{sp} packages are based on
\code{rgdal} and \code{rgeos}. \code{lidR} was based on \code{raster} and \code{sp} because it was created before \code{sf}, \code{terra}
and \code{stars} packages. This means that sooner or later users and packages that are still based on
old R spatial packages will run into trouble. According to Edzer Pebesma, Roger Bivand: \cr\cr
\emph{R users who have been around a bit longer, in particular before packages like \code{sf} and \code{stars} were
developed, may be more familiar with older packages like \code{maptools}, \code{sp}, \code{rgeos}, and \code{rgdal}. A fair
question is whether they should migrate existing code and/or existing R packages depending on these
packages. The answer is: yes (see reference).}\cr\cr
lidR 4.0.0 no longer uses \code{sp} and \code{raster}. New functions are based on \code{sf} and \code{stars}.
However to maintain backward compatibility the old functions from v<4.0.0 were preserved. The old
functions are using the new functions and automatically cast the output to the old format. The old
functions are not formally deprecated but users should definitively move their workflow to modern
spatial package. lidR will maintain the old functions as long as it does not generate troubles
on CRAN. So, it might be until Jan 1st 2024 or later who knows...
