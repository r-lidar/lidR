\description{
This function is made to be used in \link{grid_terrain} or \link{lasnormalize}. It implements an algorithms
for spatial interpolation. Spatial interpolation is based on a Delaunay triangulation. It performs
a linear interpolation within each triangle. There are usually a few points outside the convex hull,
determined by the ground points at the very edge of the dataset, which cannot be interpolated with
a triangulation. Extrapolation is done using the nearest neighbour.

\examples{
LASfile <- system.file("extdata", "Topography.laz", package="lidR")
las = readLAS(LASfile)

# plot(las)

dtm = grid_terrain(las, algorithm = knnidw(k = 6L, p = 2))

plot(dtm, col = terrain.colors(50))
plot3d(dtm)
