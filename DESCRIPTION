Description: Airborne LiDAR interface for data
    visualisation and manipulation. It has been designed mainly for use in forestry
    applications. The lidR package allows computation of digital elevation canopy models,
    point classification based on geographic shapefiles, space
    rasterization, computation of derived metrics, point filtering, artificial point
    reduction and other manipulations.
