\usage{
dalponte2016(chm, treetops, th_tree = 2, th_seed = 0.45,
  th_cr = 0.55, max_cr = 10, ID = "treeID")
}
\arguments{
\item{chm}{RasterLayer. Image of the canopy. Can be computed with \link{grid_canopy} or read from
an external file.}

\item{treetops}{\code{SpatialPointsDataFrame}. Can be computed with
\link[lidR:tree_detection]{tree_detection} or read from an external shapefile.}

\item{th_tree}{numeric. Threshold below which a pixel cannot be a tree. Default 2.}

\item{th_seed}{numeric. Growing threshold 1. See reference in Dalponte et al. 2016. A pixel
is added to a region if its height is greater than the tree height multiplied by this value.
It should be between 0 and 1. Default 0.45.}

\item{th_cr}{numeric. Growing threshold 2. See reference in Dalponte et al. 2016. A pixel
is added to a region if its height is greater than the current mean height of the region
multiplied by this value. It should be between 0 and 1. Default 0.55.}

\item{max_cr}{numeric. Maximum value of the crown diameter of a detected tree (in pixels).
Default 10.}

\item{ID}{character. If the \code{SpatialPointsDataFrame} contains an attribute with the ID for
each tree, the name of this attribute. This way, original IDs will be preserved. If there is no
such data trees will be numbered sequentially.}

\description{
This functions is made to be used in \link{lastrees}. It implements an algorithms for tree
segmentation based a paper published by Dalponte and Coomes (2016) algorithm (see reference).
This is a seeds + growing region algorithm. This algorithm exists in the package \code{itcSegment}.
This version has been written from the paper in C++. Consequently it is hundreds to millions times
faster to the original one. Notethat this algorithm strictly performs a segmentation, while the
original method as implemented in \code{itcSegment} and described in the manuscript also performs
a pre- and post-process when these tasks are expected to be done by the user in separate functions.

\details{
Because this algorithm works on a CHM only there is no actual need of a point cloud. Sometime the
user do not even have the point cloud that generated the CHM. \code{lidR} is a point cloud oriented
library this is why this algorithm must be used in \link{lastrees} to reafect the result into the point
cloud. However the user can use this function alone like that:
\preformatted{
 chm = raster("file/to/a/chm/")
 ttops = tree_detection(chm, lmf(3))
 crowns = dalponte2016(chm, ttops)()
}
}
\examples{
LASfile <- system.file("extdata", "MixedConifer.laz", package="lidR")
las = readLAS(LASfile, select = "xyz", filter = "-drop_z_below 0")
col = pastel.colors(200)

chm = grid_canopy(las, 0.5, p2r(0.3))
kernel = matrix(1,3,3)
chm = raster::focal(chm, w = kernel, fun = mean, na.rm = TRUE)

ttops = tree_detection(chm, lmf(4, 2))
lastrees(las, dalponte2016(chm, ttops))
plot(las, color = "treeID", colorPalette = col)
}
