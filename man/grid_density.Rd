\title{Map the pulse or point density}
\usage{
grid_density(las, res = 4)
}
\arguments{
\item{las}{An object of class \link[lidR:LAS-class]{LAS} or \link[lidR:LAScatalog-class]{LAScatalog}.}

\item{res}{numeric. The size of a grid cell in LiDAR data coordinates units. Default is 4 = 16
square meters.}
}
\value{
A \code{RasterLayer} or a \code{RasterBrick} containing a numeric in each cell. If the
\code{RasterLayer}s are written on disk when running the function with a \code{LAScatalog}, a
virtual raster mosaic is returned (see \link[gdalUtils:gdalbuildvrt]{gdalbuildvrt})
}
\description{
Creates a map of the point density. If a "pulseID" attribute is found, returns also a map of the pulse
density.
}
\section{Working with a \code{LAScatalog}}{

This section appears in each function that supports a LAScatalog as input.\cr

In \code{lidR} when the input of a function is a \link[lidR:LAScatalog-class]{LAScatalog} the
functions uses the LAScatalog processing engine. The user can modify the engine options using
the \link[lidR:catalog_options_tools]{available options}. A careful read of the
\link[lidR:LAScatalog-class]{engine documentation} is recommended to process \code{LAScatalogs}. Each
\code{lidR} function should come with a section that document the supported engine options.\cr

\code{LAScatalog} engine supports \code{.lax} files that \emph{significantly} improve the computation
speed of spatial queries using a spatial index. Users should really take advange a \code{.lax} files
but this is not mandatory.

\section{Supported processing options}{

Supported processing options for a \code{LAScatalog} in \code{grid_*} functions (in bold). For
more details see the \link[lidR:LAScatalog-class]{LAScatalog engine documentation}:
\itemize{
\item \strong{tiling_size}: How much data are loaded at once. The tiling size may be slightly modified
internally to ensure a strict continuous wall-to-wall output even when tiling size equal to 0 (processing
by file).
\item buffer: This function guarantee a strict continuous wall-to-wall output. The \code{buffer} option
is no considered.
\item \strong{alignment}: Align the processed clusters. The alignment may be slightly modified
internally to ensure a strict continuous wall-to-wall output.
\item \strong{cores}: How many cores are used.
\item \strong{progress}: Displays a progression estimation.
\item \strong{output_files}: Return the output in R or write each cluster's output in a file. Supported
templates are \code{XLEFT}, \code{XRIGHT}, \code{YBOTTOM}, \code{YTOP}, \code{XCENTER}, \code{YCENTER}
\code{ID} and, if tiling size equal to 0 (processing by file), \code{ORIGINALFILENAME}.
\item laz_compression: is not supported because this function will never write \code{las/laz} files
\item \strong{\emph{select}}: The functions \code{grid_*} usually know for you what should be loaded or not
and this options is not considered. In \link{grid_metrics} this option is respected.
\item \strong{filter}: Read only points of interest.
