\usage{
tin(..., extrapolate = knnidw(3, 1, 50))
}
\arguments{
\item{...}{unused}

\item{extrapolate}{There are usually a few points outside the convex hull, determined by the ground
points at the very edge of the dataset, that cannot be interpolated with a triangulation.
Extrapolation is done using \link{knnidw} by default.}
}
\description{
This function is made to be used in \link{rasterize_terrain} or \link{normalize_height}. It
implements an algorithm for spatial interpolation. Spatial interpolation is based on a Delaunay
triangulation, which performs a linear interpolation within each triangle. There are usually a
few points outside the convex hull, determined by the ground points at the very edge of the dataset,
that cannot be interpolated with a triangulation. Extrapolation can be performed with another algorithm.
