#' Ground Segmentation Algorithm
#'
#' This function is made to be used in \link{lasground}. It implements an algorithms for segmentation
#' of ground points based on a progressive morphological filter. This method is an implementation of
#' the Zhang et al. (2003) algorithm (see reference). Note that this is not a strict implementation
#' of Zhang et al. This algorithm works at the point cloud level without any rasterization process.
#' The morphological operator is applied on the point'cloud, not on a raster. Also, Zhang et al.
#' proposed some formulas (eq. 4, 5 and 7) to compute the sequence of windows sizes and thresholds.
#' Here, these parameters are free and specified by the user. The function \link{util_makeZhangParam}
#' enables computation of the parameters according to the original paper.
#'
#' @param ws numeric. Sequence of windows sizes to be used in filtering ground returns.
#' The values must be positive and in the same units as the point cloud (usually meters, occasionally
#' feet).
#'
#' @param th numeric. Sequence of threshold heights above the parameterized ground surface to be
#' considered a ground return. The values must be positive and in the same units as the point cloud.

#' Ground Segmentation Algorithm
#'
#' This function is made to be used in \link{lasground}. It implements an algorithms for segmentation
#' of ground points base on a Cloth Simulation Filter. This method is the a strict implementation of
#' the CSF algorithm made by Zhang et al. (2016) (see references) that relies on the orginal source
#' code written by the original author and exposed to R via the the \code{RCSF} package.
#'
#' @param sloop_smooth logical. When sharp slopes exist, set this parameter to TRUE to perform a
#' post-processing which will reduced errors.
#'
#' @param class_threshold scalar. The distance to the simulated cloth to classify point cloud into ground
#' and non-ground. The default is 0.5.
#'
#' @param cloth_resolution scalar. The distance between paticles in cloth. This is usually set to the
#' average distance of the points in the point cloud. The default value is 0.5.
#'
#' @param rigidness integer. The rididness of the cloth. 1 stands for very soft cloth (to fit rugged
#' terrain), 2 stands for medium cloth and 3 stands for hard cloth (for flat terrain). The default is 1.
#'
#' @param iterations integer. Maximum iteration for simulating cloth. The default value is 500. Usually,
#' users do not need to change this.
#'
#' @param time_step scalar. Time step when simulating the cloth under the gravity. The default value
#' is 0.65. Usually, do not change this value. It is suitable for most cases.
