**R package for Airborne LiDAR Data Manipulation and Visualization for Forestry Applications**

The lidR package provides functions to read and write `.las` and `.laz` files, plot point clouds, compute metrics using an area-based approach, compute digital canopy models, thin LiDAR data, manage a collection of LAS/LAZ files, automatically extract ground inventories, process a collection of tiles using multicore processing, segment individual trees, classify points from geographic data, and provides other tools to manipulate LiDAR data in a **research and development context.**

- ðŸ“– Read [the book](https://r-lidar.github.io/lidRbook/index.html) to get started with the lidR package.
- ðŸ’» Install `lidR` from R with: `install.packages("lidR")`
- ðŸ’µ [Sponsor `lidR`](https://github.com/sponsors/Jean-Romain). It is free and open source, but requires time and effort to develop and maintain.

`lidR` has been cited by more than 1,000 scientific papers. To cite the package use `citation()` from within R:

# Key features

<img align="right" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Jean-Romain/storage/master/README/point-cloud-rotating.gif">

### Read and display a las file

In R-fashion style the function `plot`, based on `rgl`, enables the user to display, rotate and zoom a point cloud.

```r
las <- readLAS("<file.las>")
plot(las)
```

### Compute a canopy height model

<img align="left" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Jean-Romain/storage/master/README/chm-Khosravipour.png">

`lidR` has several algorithms from the literature to compute canopy height models either point-to-raster based or triangulation based. This allows testing and comparison of some methods that rely on a CHM, such as individual tree segmentation or the computation of a canopy roughness index.

```r
las <- readLAS("<file.las>")

# Khosravipour et al. pitfree algorithm
thr <- c(0,2,5,10,15)
edg <- c(0, 1.5)
chm <- rasterize_canopy(las, 1, pitfree(thr, edg))

plot(chm)
```

### Read and display a catalog of las files

<img align="right" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Jean-Romain/storage/master/README/catalog-plot_interactive.gif">

`lidR` enables the user to manage, use and process a collection of `las` files. The function `readLAScatalog` builds a `LAScatalog` object from a folder. The function `plot` displays this collection on an interactive map using the `mapview` package (if installed).

```r
ctg <- readLAScatalog("<folder/>")
plot(ctg, map = TRUE)
```

From a `LAScatalog` object the user can (for example) extract some regions of interest (ROI) with `clip_roi()`. Using a catalog for the extraction of the ROI guarantees fast and memory-efficient clipping. `LAScatalog` objects allow many other manipulations that can be done with multicore processing.

### Individual tree segmentation

<img align="left" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Jean-Romain/storage/master/README/its-rotating-tree-segmented.gif">

The `segment_trees()` function has several algorithms from the literature for individual tree segmentation, based either on the digital canopy model or on the point-cloud. Each algorithm has been coded from the source article to be as close as possible to what was written in the peer-reviewed papers. Our goal is to make published algorithms usable, testable and comparable.

```r
las <- readLAS("<file.las>")

las <- segment_trees(las, li2012())
col <- random.colors(200)
plot(las, color = "treeID", colorPalette = col)
```

### Wall-to-wall dataset processing

<img align="right" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Jean-Romain/storage/master/README/catalog-processing.gif">

Most of the lidR functions can seamlessly process a set of tiles and return a continuous output. Users can create their own methods using the `LAScatalog` processing engine via the `catalog_apply()` function. Among other features the engine takes advantage of point indexation with lax files, takes care of processing tiles with a buffer and allows for processing big files that do not fit in memory.

```r
# Load a LAScatalog instead of a LAS file
ctg <- readLAScatalog("<path/to/folder/>")

# Process it like a LAS file
chm <- rasterize_canopy(ctg, 2, p2r())
col <- random.colors(50)
plot(chm, col = col)
```

### Full waveform

<img align="left" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Jean-Romain/storage/master/FWF/fwf.gif">

lidR can read full waveform data from LAS files and provides interpreter functions to convert the raw data into something easier to manage and display in R. The support of FWF is still in the early stages of development.

```r
fwf <- readLAS("<fullwaveform.las>")

# Interpret the waveform into something easier to manage
las <- interpret_waveform(fwf)

# Display discrete points and waveforms
x <- plot(fwf, colorPalette = "red", bg = "white")
plot(las, color = "Amplitude", add = x)
```

# About

`lidR` is developed openly by [r-lidar](https://www.r-lidar.com/).

The development of `lidR` was made possible through the financial support of [Laval University](https://www.ulaval.ca/en), the [AWARE project](https://awareproject.ca/) and [Ministry of Natural Ressources and Forests](https://www.quebec.ca/en/government/ministere/ressources-naturelles-forets) of QuÃ©bec. To continue the development of this free software, we now offer consulting, programming, and training services. For more information, please visit [our website](https://www.r-lidar.com/).
