\title{Smooth a point cloud}
\usage{
lassmooth(las, size, method = c("average", "gaussian"), shape = c("circle",
  "square"), sigma = size/6)

lasunsmooth(las)
}
\arguments{
\item{las}{An object of the class \code{LAS}}

\item{size}{numeric. The size of the windows used to smooth}

\item{method}{character. Smoothing method. Can be 'average' or 'gaussian'.}

\item{shape}{character. The shape of the windows. Can be circle or square.}

\item{sigma}{numeric. The standard deviation of the gaussian if the method is gaussian}
}
\value{
Nothing (NULL). The original object has been updated in place. The 'Z' column is now the
smoothed 'Z'. A new column 'Zraw' has been added in the original object to store the original values.
}
\description{
Point-cloud based smoothing algorithm. Two methods are avaible: average within a windows and
gaussian smooth within a windows. The original object is updated in place. The Z column is now
the smoothed Z. A new column Zraw has been added to store the original values and can be use to
retore the point cloud with \code{lasunsmooth}.
}
\details{
This method does not use raster-based method to smooth the point cloud. This is a true point cloud
smoothing. It is not really useful by itself but may be interesting in combination with filters such
as \link{lasfiltersurfacepoint} for example.
}
\examples{
LASfile <- system.file("extdata", "Megaplot.laz", package="lidR")
las = readLAS(LASfile, select = "xyz")

las = lasfiltersurfacepoints(las, 1)
plot(las)

lassmooth(las, 5, "gaussian", "circle", sigma = 2)
plot(las)

lasunsmooth(las)
plot(las)
