\usage{
pitfree(thresholds = c(0, 2, 5, 10, 15), max_edge = c(0, 1),
  subcircle = 0)
}
\arguments{
\item{thresholds}{numeric. Set of height thresholds accoring to Khosravipour et al. (2014) algorithm
description (see references)}

\item{max_edge}{numeric. Maximum edge-length of a triangle in the Delaunay triangulation.
If a triangle has an edge greater than this value it will be removed. The first number is the value
for the classical triangulation (threshold = 0, see also \link{dsmtin}), the second number
is the value for the pit-free algorithm (for thresholds > 0). If \code{max_edge = 0} no trimming
is done (see examples).}

\item{subcircle}{numeric. radius of the circles. To obtain fewer empty pixels the algorithm
can replace each return with a circle composed of 8 points (see details).}
}
\description{
This function is made to be used in \link{grid_canopy}. It implements the pit-free algorithm
developed by Khosravipour et al. (2014), which is based on the computation of a set of classical
triangulations at different heights (see references). The \code{subcircle} tweak replaces each
point with 8 points around the original one. This allows for virtual 'emulation' of the fact that
a lidar point is not a point as such, but more realistically a disc. This tweak densifies the point
cloud and the resulting canopy model is smoother and contains fewer 'pits' and empty pixels.
