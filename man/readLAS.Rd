\title{Read .las or .laz files}
\usage{
readLAS(files, select = "*", filter = "")
}
\arguments{
\item{files}{characters. Path(s) to one or several a file(s). Can also be a
\link[lidR:LAScatalog-class]{LAScatalog} object.}

\item{select}{character. Read only attibutes of interest to save memory (see details)}

\item{filter}{character. Read only points of interest to save memory (see details)

\strong{Select:} the 'select' argument specifies which attribute will actually be loaded. For example,
'xyzia' means that the x, y, and z coordinates, the intensity and the scan angle will be loaded.
The supported entries are t - gpstime, a - scan angle, i - intensity, n - number of returns,
r - return number, c - classification, u - user data, p - point source ID, e - edge of
flight line flag, d - direction of scan flag, R - red channel of RGB color, G - green
channel of RGB color, B - blue channel of RGB color, N - near infrared channel. Also numbers from
1 to 9 are available for the extra bytes data 1 to 9. 0 enables loading of all extra bytes and '*'
is the wildcard and enables everything to be loaded from the LAS file. Note that x, y, z are implicit
and always loaded. 'xyzia' is equivalent to 'ia'.\cr\cr
\strong{Filter:} the 'filter' argument allows filtering of the point cloud while reading files.
This is much more efficient than \link{lasfilter} in many ways. If the desired filters are known
before reading the file, the internal filters should always be preferred. The available filters are
those from \code{LASlib} and can be found by running the following command: rlas:::lasfilterusage().

\value{
A LAS object
}
\description{
Reads .las or .laz files in format 1 to 4 according to LAS specifications and returns an
object of class \link[lidR:LAS-class]{LAS}. If several files are read at once the returned LAS object
is considered as one LAS file. The optional parameters enable the user to save a substantial amount
of memory by choosing to load only the attributes or points of interest.
}
\examples{
LASfile <- system.file("extdata", "Megaplot.laz", package="lidR")
las = readLAS(LASfile)
las = readLAS(LASfile, select = "xyz")
las = readLAS(LASfile, select = "xyzi", filter = "-keep_first")
las = readLAS(LASfile, select = "xyziar", filter = "-keep_first -drop_z_below 0")

# Negation of attribute is also possible (all except intensity and angle)
las = readLAS(LASfile, select = "* -i -a")
}
