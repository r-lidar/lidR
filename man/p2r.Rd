\title{Digital Surface Model Algorithm}
\usage{
p2r(subcircle = 0)
}
\arguments{
\item{subcircle}{numeric. radius of the circles. To obtain fewer empty pixels the algorithm
can replace each return with a circle composed of 8 points (see details).}
}
\description{
This function is made to be used in \link{grid_canopy}. It implements an algorithms for digital
surface model computation based on a points-to-raster method: for each pixel of the output raster
the function attributes the height of the highest point found. The \code{subcircle} tweak replaces
each point with 8 points around the original one. This allows for virtual 'emulation' of the fact
that a lidar point is not a point as such, but more realistically a disc. This tweak densifies the
point cloud and the resulting canopy model is smoother and contains fewer 'pits' and empty pixels.

\examples{
LASfile <- system.file("extdata", "MixedConifer.laz", package="lidR")
las <- readLAS(LASfile)
col <- height.colors(50)

# Points-to-raster algorithm with a resolution of 1 meters
chm <- grid_canopy(las, res = 1, p2r())
plot(chm, col = col)

# Points-to-raster algorithm with a resolution of 0.5 meter replacing each
# point by a 20 cm radius circle of 8 points
chm <- grid_canopy(las, res = 0.5, p2r(0.2))
plot(chm, col = col)
