\title{lidR: airborne LiDAR for forestry applications}
\description{
lidR provides a set of tools to manipulate airborne LiDAR data in forestry contexts. The package
works with .las or .laz files. The toolbox includes algorithms for DSM, CHM, DTM, ABA,
normalisation, tree detection, tree segmentation, tree delineation, colourization, validation and
other tools, as well as a processing engine to process broad LiDAR coverage split into many files.
}

find unofficial supplementary documentation in the \href{https://jean-romain.github.io/lidRbook/}{lidR book}.

\section{Package options}{

\describe{
\item{\code{lidR.progress}}{Several functions have a progress bar for long operations (but not all).
Should lengthy operations show a progress bar? Default: TRUE}
\item{\code{lidR.progress.delay}}{The progress bar appears only for long operations. After how many seconds
of computation does the progress bar appear? Default: 2}
\item{\code{lidR.raster.default}}{The functions that return a raster are raster agnostic meaning
that they work either with rasters from packages `raster`, `stars` or `terra`. By default they return
rasters from `stars`. Can be one of "raster", "stars" or "terra". Default: "stars"}
\item{\code{lidR.check.nested.parallelism}}{The catalog processing engine (\link{catalog_apply})
checks the parallel strategy chosen by the user and verify if C++ parallelization with
OpenMP should be disabled to avoid nested parallel loops. Default: TRUE. If FALSE
the catalog processing engine will not check for nested parallelism
and will respect the settings of \link{set_lidr_threads}.}
